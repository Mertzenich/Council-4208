"The richness, the grandeur, the complexities of the prayers, the gestures, the movements of the Traditional Latin Mass far surpasses that of the Novus Ordo Missae which purposely sought to make the liturgy supposedly more accessible to modern men who appreciated, we were told, a more down to earth, pedestrian experience at Holy Mass. And this jettisoning of our liturgical inheritance…which is something of priceless worth…the loss of our very patrimony as Latin Rite Catholics…was done, we were told, for the sake of man…for the sake of the apostolate…for the sake of filling up the churches with countless modern people. Well…how did the liturgical experiment work? Judging from the number of church closings over the last few decades…it didn’t work that well."
