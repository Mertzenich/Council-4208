You have to see what you're missing if you don't attend the monthly Council meeting
<!--more-->
You're missing a lot if you don't come to Knights of Columbus meetings. The meal before the meeting is always delicious. Sometimes we have steak fries. Sometimes it's chili. And there are other wonderful things. This month, it was yummy Iowa Chops and trimmings (see picture below). And along with all of this wonderful food comes the fellowship and charitable activity to serve Christ. Great times! Join us. https://www.kofc.org/secure/en/join/join-the-knights.html
