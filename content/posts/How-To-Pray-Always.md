The way to repent and to growth in holiness is to "pray always."

But how is it possible to "pray always?" Saint Benedict, our patron Saint, reminds us that we must "pray and work" (ora et labora). Our work becomes a living prayer when we offer it up to God as a Sacrificial offering for our sins and the sins of others and for our growth in holiness. Outside of work, we must pray continually, even when we rest. But how can we pray continually. How can we do what the CCC indicates: "It is possible to offer fervent prayer even while walking in public or strolling alone, or seated in your shop, . . . while buying or selling, . . . or even while cooking" ( http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2743.htm ). Here's a suggestion as to how to pray continually and not be distracted:

Pray the Rosary whenever one is in any of the situations mentioned in the preceding paragraph, that is, pray the Rosary at all times when one is not in need of focussing mental effort on a particular problem. But how is one to pray the Rosary (https://www.rosarycenter.org/homepage-2/rosary/how-to-pray-the-rosary/) without distraction. Here's how:

Personalize the Apostle's Creed in the following way: “I believe in You God, the Father almighty. You are the creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, Your only Son, my Lord. Jesus, You were conceived by the Holy Spirit, You were born of the Virgin Mother, You suffered under Pontius Pilate, You were crucified, You died, and You were buried. You descended into hell. On the third day Your rose again from the dead. You ascended into heaven and You are seated at the right hand of God, the Father almighty. From there You will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.”

Personalize the Our Father (the Lord's prayer) in the following way: "My Father, You are in heaven. Your Name is holy; Your Kingdom is here; Your will is being done on earth just as Your will is being done in heaven. Please give me this day [some grace or some sin to avoid] and forgive me my sins to the same extent that I forgive ["those who sin against me" or "myself"]; and lead me not [to sin in a general or particular way or to avoid that which I should be doing], but deliver me from the temptation to [do this or that or in any way sin]. Amen.”

Personalize the Hail Mary in the following way; some options follow: --“Hail Mother, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, And blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Queen, Mother of God [or Jesus], pray for me, a sinner, now through the moment of my death. Amen.”
--“Hail Mother, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, And blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Queen, Mother of God [or Jesus], pray for me, a sinner, that I may not [name the sin], now through the moment of my death. Amen.”
--“Hail Mother, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, And blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Queen, Mother of God [or Jesus], pray for [a person, place, or thing]. Amen.”

Personalize the Glory Be in the following way: Glory to You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, one God. You were, you are, and you will be forever and ever, world without end. Amen.

The important point for all of the above is to bring these prayers into personal language when you are praying by yourself. When you're by yourself, pray to God as an individual. And be sure that your mind is active, that the words don't become senseless repetition, that you are truly engaged in conversation with God. The Rosary is a tool, a very important tool, but the tool must be honed to be of maximum effectiveness. You don't have to memorize anything written above. Just convert the Rosary prayers to your personal dialog with God almighty. Engage your brain while praying. Offer personalized prayers that go along with the particular mysteries of the Rosary. For example, for the third joyful mystery, personalize the prayers such that you ask God to make you childlike in the Faith. “Hail Mother, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, And blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Queen, Mother of God [or Jesus], pray for me, a sinner, that I may become like a little child in the Fiath, now through the moment of my death. Amen.” Ask the Holy Spirit for help. He *WILL* help you! And you will grow in holiness and decrease in vice and sin, and you will find yourself helping others in a way you've never done before; that is, you will be loving your neighbor like never before. And it will be a pure love, a love that comes from the love of God for you.
