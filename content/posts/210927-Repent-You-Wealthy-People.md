It's time for the materially wealthy of the world to repent!
<!--more-->
"Come now, you rich, weep and wail over your impending miseries.
Your wealth has rotted away, your clothes have become moth-eaten,
your gold and silver have corroded,
and that corrosion will be a testimony against you;
it will devour your flesh like a fire.
You have stored up treasure for the last days...You have lived on earth in luxury and pleasure;
you have fattened your hearts for the day of slaughter." (From https://bible.usccb.org/bible/readings/092621.cfm)

What are you doing to love your neighbor as yourself? Are you hoarding your goods? Are you living it up and not helping others? Are you not praying much? Are you simply going to Mass weekly because someone once told you that that's what you're supposed to do, but you really don't know why? Are you not going to Mass at all and are totally focussed on the things of this world? If any or all of these apply to you, it's time to change your ways, that is, it's time to repent! Listen to the words of Thomas a Kempis: "VERY soon your life here will end; consider, then, what may be in store for you elsewhere. Today we live; tomorrow we die and are quickly forgotten. Oh, the dullness and hardness of a heart which looks only to the present instead of preparing for that which is to come!"

How do we repent? It's simple. We turn to God, ask His forgiveness, and start helping others. And a great way to help others is to join the band of brothers whose goal it is to serve God and people: The Knights of Columbus. Join us! https://www.kofc.org/secure/en/join/join-the-knights.html
