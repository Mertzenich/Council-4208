It is important for a Catholic to examine his conscience before retiring every evening.
<!--more-->

Make a short examination of conscience at the end of the day before going to bed. Two or three minutes is enough. Follow these steps:
(1) Humble yourself in the presence of God.
(2) Tell him, “Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.”
(3) Ask for light to acknowledge your defects and virtues and to see the dangers and opportunities of the day.
(4) Ask for repentance, amendment, and encouragement.
