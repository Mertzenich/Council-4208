Many, many Catholics have stopped partaking of the Sacraments of the Church. Let us pray for their return to active participation in the one, holy, Catholic, and apostolic Faith.

"Dear Lord, Jesus Christ, in your precious name, I pray for the strengthening of the Catholic faith among my children and for the return to your blessed Church of all lapsed and non-practicing Catholics . . . for the strengthening and/or return of your Catholic flock of sheep to you, our Divine Shepard, and to your divinely ordained Holy Catholic Church."
