Our Lady of Fatima has requested that we make the Five First Saturdays devotion. Please put it on your calendar. 2 October 2021 is the next First Saturday. Click on the link for simple instructions to make this critical devotion. All Knights of Columbus and their families should pray the Rosary daily, wear the Brown Scapular (https://fatima.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/brown_scapular_2019.pdf), and make the Five First Saturdays devotion.
