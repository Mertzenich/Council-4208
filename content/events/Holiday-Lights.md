ALL KC MEMBERS: December 20th will be KC help evening at the holiday lights. We will do the collections and direct cars in and out from 5pm to 9pm. Dress warm. Be at the Decorah camp grounds at 4:50 pm. The Holiday Lights organizers have flash lights and reflective vests for safety. You may bring a friend or family member to help as well. School kids: It's Silver Cord time-just bring a paper to sign.
