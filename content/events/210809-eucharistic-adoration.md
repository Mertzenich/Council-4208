Eucharistic adoration will occur on Monday 9 August 2021.

Hello Adorers,

Below are some possible intentions for your time in adoration. May the Lord work in and through your prayers. 

For families who are overwhelmed by the pace of life and the responsibilities before them.
For those discerning their vocation to married life, the priesthood, or the religious life.
For our neighbors and neighborhood. 
"Dear Lord, Jesus Christ, in your precious name, I pray for the strengthening of the Catholic faith among my children and for the return to your blessed Church of all lapsed and non-practicing Catholics . . . for the strengthening and/or return of your Catholic flock of sheep to you, our Divine Shepard, and to your divinely ordained Holy Catholic Church."

Thank you for your prayers for our parish.

Yours in Ora et Labora,

Eucharistic adoration information

-->Eucharistic adoration occurs in the Saint Benedict's parish chapel each Monday, except when preempted by a funeral, adverse weather conditions, or a major holiday; call 563-382-9631 if you have questions. All people are welcome. Knights of Columbus are strongly encouraged to engage in Eucharistic adoration. [Please note that during the coronavirus/COVID19/Wuhan virus situation in 2020, Eucharistic adoration has been moved to the main section of the Church building.]

-->Normally,
1) exposition of the blessed Sacrament takes place at 7:00 am;
2) Eucharistic adoration closes with Benediction at 7:45-8:00 pm.

-->Please note the policy for days when there is no Eucharistic adoration or a delayed exposition of the blessed Sacrament:
1) Beginning Labor Day 2019, we will not normally be holding Eucharistic adoration on major holidays that fall on Monday, such as Memorial Day, Labor Day, Independence Day.
2) Another more frequent change is that when a funeral is scheduled for Mondays, adoration will not begin until 1:00
pm or will be cancelled entirely.

285. How long does the presence of Christ last in the Eucharist?

The presence of Christ continues in the Eucharist as long as the eucharistic species subsist.

Further reading: CCC 1377

286. What kind of worship is due to the sacrament of the Eucharist?
The worship due to the sacrament of the Eucharist, whether during the celebration of the Mass or outside it, is the worship of latria, that is, the adoration given to God alone. The Church guards with the greatest care Hosts that have been consecrated. She brings them to the sick and to other persons who find it impossible to participate at Mass. She also presents them for the solemn adoration of the faithful and she bears them in processions. The Church encourages the faithful to make frequent visits to adore the Blessed Sacrament reserved in the tabernacle.
