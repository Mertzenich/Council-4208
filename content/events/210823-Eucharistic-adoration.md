Eucharistic Adoration in Saint Benedict's Parish
<!--more-->


Eucharistic adoration

-->Eucharistic adoration occurs in the Saint Benedict's parish each Monday, except when preempted by a funeral, adverse weather conditions, or a major holiday; call 563-382-9631 if you have questions. All people are welcome. Knights of Columbus are strongly encouraged to engage in Eucharistic adoration. [Please note that during the coronavirus/COVID19/Wuhan virus situation in 2020, Eucharistic adoration has been moved to the main section of the Church building.]

-->Normally,
1) exposition of the blessed Sacrament takes place at 7:00 am;
2) Eucharistic adoration closes with Benediction at 7:45-8:00 pm.

-->Please note the policy for days when there is no Eucharistic adoration or a delayed exposition of the blessed Sacrament:
1) Beginning Labor Day 2019, we will not normally be holding Eucharistic adoration on major holidays that fall on Monday, such as Memorial Day, Labor Day, Independence Day.
2) Another more frequent change is that when a funeral is scheduled for Mondays, adoration will not begin until 1:00
pm or will be cancelled entirely.
Call 563-382-9631 if you have questions.

Please seriously consider spending some time in adoration of our exposed Eucharistic Lord. Please feel free to visit for as long or as short a time as you like. You can also sign up to be present with the Lord for an hour or more each week; call 563-382-9631 or email stbenedict@stbenedictcc.com .

285. How long does the presence of Christ last in the Eucharist?

The presence of Christ continues in the Eucharist as long as the eucharistic species subsist.

Further reading: CCC 1377

286. What kind of worship is due to the sacrament of the Eucharist?
The worship due to the sacrament of the Eucharist, whether during the celebration of the Mass or outside it, is the worship of latria, that is, the adoration given to God alone. The Church guards with the greatest care Hosts that have been consecrated. She brings them to the sick and to other persons who find it impossible to participate at Mass. She also presents them for the solemn adoration of the faithful and she bears them in processions. The Church encourages the faithful to make frequent visits to adore the Blessed Sacrament reserved in the tabernacle.
