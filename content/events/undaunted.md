Undaunted: A Gathering for Men
<!--more-->
This is a reflective, quiet time that aims to help men experience a moment of peace and recollection. This is done through Eucharistic adoration, Reconciliation and/or optional time to chat and enjoy coffee. No ice breakers, no sharing. Come and go as you please.
