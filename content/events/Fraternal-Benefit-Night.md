Van’s Topic  “Financial Success Under Any Circumstance”

Van will ask some wonderful compelling questions that will help you clarify how to have financial and retirement success.  Here are a few examples.

How can you maximize your social security?     
Do you prefer to build a legacy for your family and business or the Internal Revenue Service?     
If there was a way to reduce or eliminate the income tax liability on your IRA or 401K, when would you want to know about it.  Before or after they charge the tax?     
Can you build a wonderful retirement income if interest rates remain at zero and the  stock market offers zero return for a decade?
