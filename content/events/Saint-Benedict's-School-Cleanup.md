<!--more-->
we will need help to spread the wood chips under the playground equipment. 

Monday evening July 25, bring gloves, garden rakes, wheel barrow, shovels!! 

Start about 330 to 4pm. 

We will have water, soft drinks, snacky food available. 

Leave when you have to... bring a friend to help. 

Spouses can help... so can some of the bigger kids!



Also, need to pull weeds in the flower beds and refresh the wood chips.
