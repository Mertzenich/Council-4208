FAITH & DESSERT SERIES

-WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The program will include dessert, adult-oriented catechesis (religious instruction), fellowship & conversation, and Benediction. You can come to any session; the programs stand alone.

-TOPIC FOR MONDAY 25 OCTOBER 2021 PROGRAM: MANâ€™S RELATIONSHIP TO GOD

-WHEN & WHERE IT WILL TAKE PLACE: This program started on Monday 23 August 2021. It takes place in Saint Benedict's parish hall. It will run the 4th Monday of the following months @ 7 pm: August, September, October, January, February, March. Program will end each time @ 7:45 pm with Benediction; thus, this program will be short, SWEET (dessert!), and educational.

-WHO'S DOING THIS: Sponsored by the Knights of Columbus, but this is NOT limited to members of the Knights of Columbus. All people are invited!!!!!!!!!! Feel free to invite friends, acquaintances, and family members. Remember: What you don't know *CAN* hurt you!

-HOW MUCH THIS WILL COST: There is no cost to the participant, but a free will offering will be accepted. Money will be used to help defray costs and to give to local charities.

-RSVP: Contact us at decorahknights@gmail.com to let us know if you're planning to attend so that we can have the right amount of dessert, beverage, and catechetical materials.

-CHILD CARE: Although child care will not be provided, feel free to bring children along.

-WHY THIS IS BEING DONE: It has become clear that adult Catholics are sorely in need of education in the Faith. This program seeks to help in this area by being stimulating, engaging, relatively brief, prayerful, enjoyable, and yummy.
