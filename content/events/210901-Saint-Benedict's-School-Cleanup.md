Saint Benedict's School Grounds Cleanup on 2 September 2021
<!--more-->
Call from Pro Earth in West Union,,, wood chips are ready to pick up. Joel will pick up a load today (Tuesday) as he has an order in Eldorado.
Because of the recent rains , We decided to dump the chips in the parking area. That means we need extra help and pickups or trailers to haul the wood chips back to the playground. Otherwise, we would tear up the playground with the heavy truck tracks.

I am asking Darin and Bonnie and Kristy to use their email lists to contact as many as possible to help work the wood chips and pull grass from the flower beds. Also need to pull grass from the volley ball sand pit and the ball diamond as needed.

The Decorah Knights of Columbus is providing the wood chips but will need help to distribute them and upkeep the rest of the Playground. Helpers should bring garden rakes, shovels , silage forks, wheel barrows, gloves and weeding tools. Maybe a small tractor or two to load wood chips. As mentioned above, pickups or/and smaller trailers to haul the chips.

We plan to do this playground upkeep on Thursday evening (Sept. 2 ) starting about 330 pm. Of course, this is at St. Benedict School, 402 Rural Ave.
Come when you can, leave when you have to. Bottled water and soft drinks will be provided as well as individual packaged snacks (Co-Vid you know). In the past, we have finished in 2 hours to almost sundown... Depends on how much help shows. AND... some of us age each year!!!
The weather forecast was looking good until Friday.
Hope you can make it down to help.
THANKS, Saint Benedict's Council 4208
